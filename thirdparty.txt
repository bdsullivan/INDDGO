INDDGO is compatible and can be enhanced by functionality from a number of 
third-party software packages. 

You can enable and disable all optional third party software via the 
HAS_XXX variables in your make.inc. 
Please set the associated directory variables in make.inc 
appropriately so the needed libraries and source can be found for linking. 

Below are the download locations for the third-party software packages, 
and which versions we have tested with:

SUITESPARSE /*tested with 4.0.0*/
/*NOTE: As of right now, METIS-4.0 usage inside SuiteSparse is not supported;
 * you must compile with -DNPARTITION, which can be added to a compile flag 
 * in SuiteSparse_config.mk. For use with INDDGO 'make library' is sufficient.

WARNING: Known issues with builds: 
1. AMD does not seem to compile on the most recent Mac OS. No serious attempts at debugging have been made.
2. You must have cmake installed for METIS/ParMETIS to build. The latter also needs MPI.

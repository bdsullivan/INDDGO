INDDGO is compatible and can be enhanced by functionality from a number of 
third-party software packages. 

You can enable and disable all optional third party software via the 
HAS_XXX variables in your make.inc. 
Please set the associated directory variables in make.inc 
appropriately so the needed libraries and source can be found for linking. 

Below are the download locations for the third-party software packages, 
and which versions we have tested with:

AMD: /*tested with 2.2.3 (also known compatible with 2.2.0)*/
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/amd/

SuiteSparse_config (required by AMD) /*tested with 3.7.0 (also known compatible with 3.4.0), which was named UFconfig; initial testing shows compatibility with version 4.0.0*/
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse_config/

ARPACK: /*Note we do not use ARPACK++*/

CSDP: /*Tested with 6.1.1*/
https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp/

METIS: /*Tested with 5.0.2 - INCOMPATIBLE with 4.x*/
ParMETIS: /*Tested with 4.0.2 - INCOMPATIBLE with 4.x; Contains METIS 5.0.2 in metis subdirectory*/

WARNING: Known issues with builds: 
1. AMD does not seem to compile on the most recent Mac OS. No serious attempts at debugging have been made.
2. You must have cmake installed for METIS/ParMETIS to build. The latter also needs MPI.

Pre-requisites for INDDGO:
  - For parallel versions:
    - an MPI compiler (tested with OpenMPI and Cray MPI)
    - a C++ compiler capable of compiling OpenMP code (tested with GCC >= 4.4.3)

  - For building versions with MADNESS:
    - autoconf
    - automake

Configuration:
  To configure INDDGO, a make.inc file must be created, containing
  the various options for compilers and optional software packages.

  We provide two example files, make.inc.parallel and make.inc.serial
  to get you started.  Simply copy one of these files to make.inc.
  Next, edit it and set the "SRC_DIR" variable to the directory where
  you unpacked INDDGO. 
  
  Various HAS_<PACKAGENAME> variables may be set.  If set, you must also
  set the corresponding directory variable further on in the make.inc.

  Note that trailing spaces in your variable declarations may cause 
  Make to fail in seemingly random ways (directories and 0/1 values are 
  particularly susceptible).

  We provide a copy of the MADNESS runtime library, however other
  dependencies must be installed manually.

  For details on where to obtain optional dependencies and their required
  versions, see the thirdparty.txt file.

Compilation:
  To compile INDDGO, follow these steps:

make

  Resulting binaries will be places in SRC_DIR/bin.  INDDGO also provides
  various non-default binaries that may be built for testing purposes.
  These will be placed in the appropriate sub-package's /bin directory.

  The max_wis/bin directory contains the serial_wis binary which is the 
  most well-tested. It can be used to solve WIS instances and also do
  general purpose tree decomposition-related tasks. See the README
  in the max_wis directory for more details.

  Tested with the GNU compilers (g++, gcc, version >= 4.4.3) and OpenMPI. 
  No support is provided for non-GCC compilers.

Mac users: 
  Tested with default xcode gcc 4.2.1. You need to set the OLDGCC variable
  in your make.inc file. 
  WARNING: Some MADNESS developers have reported problems
  with the new Lion (10.7) MacOS version causing runtime errors, including 
  segmentation faults and incorrect results in upper-level MADNESS 
  functionality. Since INDDGO's parallel dynamic programming relies on 
  the MADNESS runtime, similar problems may occur (we have not done extensive 
  testing). One possible solution is to compile for Snow Leopard (10.6), 
  which can be done by setting an environment variable. 

Here are details on how to obtain Metis and SuiteSparse, compile them, and
instruct INDDGO to use these additional capabilities. The links are current
as of 20121104:

The top level directory for this example is /home/cgroer.
It will contain INDDGO, Metis, and SuiteSparse.

> cd /home/cgroer
> mkdir INDDGO 
> git clone https://github.com/bdsullivan/INDDGO.git
> wget http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/metis/metis-5.0.2.tar.gz
> tar xzvf metis-5.0.2.tar.gz
> cd metis-5.0.2
> make config
> make
> OPTIONAL: make install
> cd ..
> wget http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/SuiteSparse/SuiteSparse-4.0.2.tar.gz
> tar xzvf SuiteSparse-4.0.2.tar.gz
> cd SuiteSparse
> make
> OPTIONAL: make install
> cd ..
> cd INDDGO

< Edit make.inc, example edit below >

SRC_DIR = /home/cgroer/INDDGO
...
HAS_SUITESPARSE = 1
...
HAS_METIS	= 1
...
SUITESPARSE = /home/cgroer/SuiteSparse
...
METIS_SRC_DIR  = /home/cgroer/metis-5.0.2 
METIS_LIB_DIR = /home/cgroer/metis-5.0.2/build/Linux-x86_64/libmetis
